> **Averag**e + **U**niversity of **M**inho

In the course of Software Engineering of the University of Minho, to calculate
the average, you need to take into account weighting factors.

Fill with your grades the classification column in the file `data/courses.csv`
(please, save it in UTF-8) and then run the [Python](averagum.py) script.

The first field, `avg`, is your weighted average at the moment.
